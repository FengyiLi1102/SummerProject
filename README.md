Contents:
---------
- [Pandas_notes](https://github.com/FengyiLi1102/SummerProject/blob/master/Pandas_notes.ipynb): The note for Pandas is based on contents from Kaggle courses.

- [sklearn_note](https://github.com/FengyiLi1102/SummerProject/blob/master/sklearn_notes.ipynb): The note contains some useful contents for machine learning.

- [Numpy_notes](https://github.com/FengyiLi1102/SummerProject/blob/master/numpy_notes.ipynb): The note is made by contents met during the competition.

- [main](https://github.com/FengyiLi1102/SummerProject/blob/master/main.py):
  It includes ten features:
  - electronegativity (both atoms) [mean, std, min, max]
  - radius (both atoms) [mean, std, min, max]
  - bond angles
  - pi bonds (both atoms) [mean, std, min, max]
  - hybridization (both atoms) [mean, std, min, max]
  - distance [mean, std]
  - position (both atoms) [x, y, z]
  
  This is the main file of the competition. It consists of several steps: 
  - Loading of data
  - Data pre-processing
  - Model selection
  - Training
  - Prediction
